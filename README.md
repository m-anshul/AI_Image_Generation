# AI Image Generation Project using MERN Stack and OpenAI API

## Project Overview

This project is an AI Image Generation application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack and integrated with the OpenAI API. The purpose of this application is to demonstrate the capabilities of artificial intelligence in generating images based on user input.

## Features

1. **User Authentication:** Users can sign up, log in, and log out securely to access the image generation features.

2. **Image Generation:** Leveraging the OpenAI API, users can input textual prompts or descriptions, and the AI will generate images based on those prompts.

3. **Save and Download Images:** Users can save the generated images and download them for future use.

4. **Gallery:** A gallery feature allows users to view and manage their previously generated images.

## Technologies Used

- **MERN Stack:**
  - MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing user data and generated images.
  - Express.js: Backend framework for handling API requests.
  - React.js: Frontend library for building interactive user interfaces.
  - Node.js: Server-side JavaScript runtime.

- **OpenAI API:**
  - Integrated to facilitate AI-powered image generation.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-image-generation.git

2. Navigate to Project Directory:

   ```bash
     cd ai-image-generation

3. Install Dependencies for the Server:

   ```bash
     cd server
     npm install

4. Install Dependencies for the Client:

   ```bash
     cd client
     npm install

5. Set up the environment variables:

   Create a .env file in the server directory and add the necessary variables, including OpenAI API keys and MongoDB connection string.

6. Run the Application:

   ```bash
     cd server
     npm start
